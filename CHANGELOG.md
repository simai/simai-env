# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.7.9] - 2025-12-29
### Fixed
- Standardized Laravel scheduler to `/etc/cron.d/<project>` and implemented cron add/remove commands.

### Security/Docs
- Healthcheck output/docs now clarify `/healthcheck.php` is localhost-only by default.

## [0.7.8] - 2025-12-29
### Security
- Lock down `/healthcheck.php` to localhost-only access by default in nginx templates.

### Docs
- Clarify when `--confirm yes` is required for `site remove` and `ssl remove`, with examples.

## [0.7.7] - 2025-12-29
### Fixed
- Site removal now only requires confirmation when destructive flags are set, while safe removals proceed without extra prompts.
- SSL removal only asks for confirmation when certificates are being deleted (`delete-cert=yes`), avoiding unnecessary blocks.
- Nginx configs are backed up before regeneration across admin and simai-env with a consistent `.bak.<timestamp>` naming scheme.

### Security
- MySQL user creation no longer drops existing `@%` accounts automatically and continues to create local-only users by default.
- Confirmation gating now targets destructive actions only, reducing unintended stoppages while keeping dangerous operations explicit.
